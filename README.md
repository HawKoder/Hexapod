# Hexapod
This is the open source project for an Arduino based Hexapod, use it, prototype it and let me see your droid.

You must have in mind that until this moment the project was not tested. Pay attention for the updates because it will be protoyped in 3D printing briefly. You must try to reduce the weight on base to minimum possible because there is just one support on servo axis. I will test it with 2 Arduino Nano, one ESP8266, one servo driver with 16 channels, one MPU9255 or GPS and one ultrasound.

I hope that it can works with this weight.
